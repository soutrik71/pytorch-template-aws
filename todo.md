**__Pytorch Lightning Classifier with Hydra DVC and Linting and Pytest Deployed on AWS EC2__**:
- Find and train a new model on a same dataset
- Imbibe the concept of torchscript for model deployment
- New hydra configuration for the model with new experiment and all the configurations
- create gradio app.py for UI deployment
- create a new github action for first train and test a model then deploy it on AWS EC2
- For Aws ec2 automatic start of the server train and test the code then deploy the model on Huggingface spaces and then close the server
- Use Boto and dvc for s3 bucket transfer of pytorch model and data files for training and testing the model on AWS EC2 server
